        Provide clear steps to reproduce the bug. Ideally, include a code block that demonstrates the issue. Aim for a minimal, easy-to-understand example by simplifying or removing unnecessary parts of your code. Only include code leading up to where the error occursâ€”for instance, if the error is thrown on line 30, do not include any lines after that.
